# First Presentation (System Design and Risk Analysis)

Each team is given 15 min. for presentation. You should submit your presentation
file to KLMS after your presentation. We will have an individual meeting with
each team in the classroom (see the schedule section below). Presenters should
bring their own laptop.

### Schedule

- Team 1 (10:30 -- 11:00)
- Team 2 (11:00 -- 11:30)
- Team 3 (11:30 -- 12:00)

### Presentation

The presentation should show the following items.

##### Introduction

Briefly introduce your team and **team name**.

##### System Overview

Describe clearly your system's components and their relationships. Show the
functionality of each component. Specify what are expected inputs and outputs
for each component.

##### Risk Analysis

Describe potential threat sources in your system, and list all poential threats
and the corresponding counter measures.

##### Backdoor Design

Describe your plan for backdoors. Specify how you will make it difficult to
detect.

##### Current Progress and Plan for Development

Describe how you will distribute tasks to each team member. Show your GitHub
milestones and current progresses too.

### Grading

We will qualitatively evaluate your scores for the entire team-based activities,
but the below table shows a rough idea about how we will grade your scores for
