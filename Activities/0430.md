# Security Auditing Preparation Step

For this activity, you are going to play a CTF (Capture The Flag) game, although
it is completely different from regular ones.

### Preparation

- You should prepare your team's PGP key (ones that you have uploaded in this
  repository (in the `TeamKeys` directory). If you have lost your private key,
  you should let us know ASAP.

- You should also download the instructors' PGP keys.

- Most importantly, you should prepare a ZIP file for your repository. Make sure
  that your attack scripts are *NOT* included in the ZIP file. Upload it to KLMS
  by 23:59:59 4/29.

- Each team will be given an empty repository. These repositories will have
  public access. Let us know before the CTF start, if you cannot access those
  repositories.
