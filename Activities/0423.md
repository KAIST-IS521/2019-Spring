# Second Checkpoint

Each team is given 15 min. for presentation. You should submit your presentation
file to [KLMS](http://klms.kaist.ac.kr/mod/assign/view.php?id=302075) after your presentation. We will have an individual meeting with
each team in the classroom (see the schedule section below). Presenters should
bring their own laptop.

### Schedule

- Team 3 (10:30 -- 11:00)
- Team 2 (11:00 -- 11:30)
- Team 1 (11:30 -- 12:00)

### Presentation

The presentation should show the following items.

##### Brief Summary of Your Backdoors

Remind us about your backdoors.

##### Live Demo

You should show an end-to-end live demo, starting from building a docker image
to demonstrating your attacks. This way, we can make sure that your system is
easy to run by others.

##### Psychological Analysis

Show why you believe that your backdoor (the hard one) is difficult to be found
by others in temrs of their mentality.

### Grading

We will qualitatively evaluate your scores for the entire team-based activities,
but the below table shows a rough idea about how we will grade your scores for
this particular activity.
