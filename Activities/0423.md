# Second Checkpoint

Each team is given 15 min. for presentation. You should submit your presentation
file to KLMS after your presentation. We will have an individual meeting with
each team in the classroom (see the schedule section below). Presenters should
bring their own laptop.

### Schedule

- Team 3 (10:30 -- 11:00)
- Team 2 (11:00 -- 11:30)
- Team 1 (11:30 -- 12:00)

### Presentation

The presentation should show the following items.

##### Preparing for a Hint

Every team should prepare a hint for the hard backdoor. We will release your
hint 1-day (this may change) before the deadline in case no other teams have
successfully solved your challenge.

##### Brief Summary of Your Backdoors

Remind us about your backdoors.

##### Live Demo

You should show an end-to-end live demo, starting from building a docker image
to demonstrating your attacks. This way, we can make sure that your system is
easy to run by others.

##### Psychological Analysis

Show why you believe that your backdoor (the hard one) is difficult to be found
by others in temrs of their mentality.

### Grading

We will qualitatively evaluate your scores for the entire team-based activities,
but the below table shows a rough idea about how we will grade your scores for
this particular activity.

| **Criteria**                                         | Poor | Fair | Average | Good | Excellent |
|------------------------------------------------------|------|------|---------|------|-----------|
| Was the presentation clear?                          |      |      |         |      |           |
| Was the presenter passionate about the presentation? |      |      |         |      |           |
| Is the prepared hint reasonable (not too easy/hard)? |      |      |         |      |           |
| Does it work?                                        |      |      |         |      |           |
| Demo is well prepared? Was it easy to understand?    |      |      |         |      |           |
| Is the psychological analysis carefully done?        |      |      |         |      |           |
