# First Checkpoint

Each team is given 15 min. for presentation. You should submit your presentation
file to KLMS after your presentation. We will have an individual meeting with
each team in the classroom (see the schedule section below). Presenters should
bring their own laptop.

### Schedule

- Team 2 (10:30 -- 11:00)
- Team 3 (11:00 -- 11:30)
- Team 1 (11:30 -- 12:00)

### Presentation

The presentation should show the following items.

##### System Development Progress

Show your progress. Explain how each module/component is implemented by whom.

##### Backdoor Improvement

We gave some feedback to each team about their backdoor implementation. This
time, you should clearly show the progress on your backdoor development. Any new
ideas?

##### Threats to Backdoor Discovery

If other teams can find your backdoor (hard one), what would be the major factor
that allows them to do so? You should show some "risk analysis" on the discovery
of your backdoor.

### Grading

We will qualitatively evaluate your scores for the entire team-based activities,
but the below table shows a rough idea about how we will grade your scores for
this particular activity.

| **Criteria**                                                  | Poor | Fair | Average | Good | Excellent |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|---------|------|-----------|
| Was the presentation clear?                                   |      |      |         |      |           |
| Was the presenter passionate about the presentation?          |      |      |         |      |           |
| Can we observe clear improvement over the first presentation? |      |      |         |      |           |
| Can we observe reasonable progress in the s/w development?    |      |      |         |      |           |
| Workload is well distributed?                                 |      |      |         |      |           |
| Is the risk analysis (about a hard backdoor) carefully done?  |      |      |         |      |           |
